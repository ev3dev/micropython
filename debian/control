Package: micropython
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Python implementation for microcontrollers and constrained systems
 MicroPython implements the entire Python 3.4 syntax (including exceptions,
 with, yield from, etc., and additionally async/await keywords from Python
 3.5). The following core datatypes are provided: str (including basic Unicode
 support), bytes, bytearray, tuple, list, dict, set, frozenset, array.array,
 collections.namedtuple, classes and instances. Builtin modules include sys,
 time, and struct, etc. Select ports have support for _thread module
 (multithreading). Note that only a subset of Python 3 functionality is
 implemented for the data types and modules.
